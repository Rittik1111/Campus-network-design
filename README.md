# Campus-network-design

# Description
A simulated campus network designed using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project demonstrates inter-department communication through the implementation of VLANs, routing protocols, and IP address planning. The network ensures secure and efficient data flow across different departments.

# Topology Overview
Departments Covered: Admin, Accounts, Labs, Library, and Staff

Devices Used: Routers, Switches, PCs, Printer
Connectivity: Wired LAN across multiple subnets and VLANs

# Technologies Used
Cisco Packet Tracer (Simulation Tool)

Routing Protocols: OSPF, RIP

VLAN Configuration: Inter-VLAN routing Switch

IP Addressing: Static

Switch & Router Configuration: CLI commands

# Features
Departmental separation using VLANs

Static and dynamic IP allocation

Routing between departments using OSPF and RIP

Fully functional and testable in Cisco Packet Tracer
